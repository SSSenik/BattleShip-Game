# BattleShip-Game
Battleship game made for a school project. 
This was a project made in C for a school project. 
I got a 20 (0-20) and my teacher told me i should share this project and here i am.

Note: this is my first big project in C so this is not a professional program so expect bad programing rules

Note2: i added a saves file if you want to test directly the game instead of setting up all the ships

Note3: if you can't play in the colored version try the other version. The colored version doesn't work in all computers
